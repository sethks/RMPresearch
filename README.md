This is a personal python project that I made in my free time as I was curious about the data behind Rate My Professor, and what kind of relationships could be seen when the data is extracted from the website. 

## Step 1:
I first needed to find a way to extract the data from RateMyProfessor, so with a bit of research and help from user tisuela here on github I was able to organize a function that "organized" each professor at Boston University into a "sorted" dictionary like such.
