This is a personal python project that I made in my free time as I was curious about the data behind Rate My Professor, and what 
kind of relationships could be seen when the data is extracted from the website. 



## Step 1: Extracting
I first needed to find a way to extract the data from RateMyProfessor, so with a bit of research and help from user tisuela 
here on github I was able to organize a function that "organized" each professor at Boston University into a "sorted" dictionary like such.

As you can see this data isn't something that is easy to work with so of course I have to clean it up.

## Step 2: Building and Visualizing
With the data extracted and cleaned up I was able to now import the 3000+ columns of data into multiple data manipulating programs.
One of those happened to be Tableau which is one of the most powerful data visualizing programs I have ever used.

A very interesting find was that two of the highest rated departments at BU are in the Writing and Language department. Not only are they top two 
highest rated departments, but they also have of the most reviews out of any department. This information seemed to line up with the fact that 
Communication and Journalism is the third most popular major at BU.
